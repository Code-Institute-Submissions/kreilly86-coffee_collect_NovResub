        We started Coffee Collect in 2020 during the Covid Pandemic as a way to keep connected with our colleagues
        in the coffee industry. We are a growing resource for coffee professionals and drinkers to learn more
        about where there coffee comes from and highlight some of the unique qualities of the coffee regions we
        represent.
        Too often we consume coffee without thinking of the hard work that goes into it throughout the production,
        and
        distribution chain.
        <br>
        <br>
        We are hoping you will join us and begin adding your own findings to the database, as we look to
        the future of an ever more fragile industry.
